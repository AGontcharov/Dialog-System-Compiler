Dialog System Compiler (Dialogc) is an IDE compiler which takes a simplified pre-determined language and spits out an executable Java GUI code which can be run directly in the IDE or as a stand alone program. Dialogc comes with 2 compile mode: IDE Compiler and Lex/Yacc Compiler. The IDE Compiler is the in built default compiler for Dialogc which is based on a finite state machine and implemented in C. On the other hand, the Lex/Yacc Compiler is based on tokens provided by the Lexixal Analyzer Genetaor and the grammar rules defined in Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler). In addition, the Lex/Yacc Compiler can be run as a stand alone program also spitting out an executable Java GUI code.

The GUI for Dialogc is fully implemented in Java, under the Swing library and is connected straight to the IDE Compiler through the Java Native Interface (JNI). Furthermore, a bash script is provided which will guide a user through the installation of the Dialog System Compiler and install in a directory of their choice.
